# python_pytorch_keras_models
An assembly of algorithms developed in pytorch and keras for testing different approaches of wind turbine classification and normality detection.

Maybe some of those algorithms will work for your case. I have done with the wind turbine SCADA data (continuous variables) and, some of them generated good results.

The input format for the algorithms is a Table like format, with entries in rows and variables in columns, you may have to specify the target column via a variable or import in a separate variable (labelling).
